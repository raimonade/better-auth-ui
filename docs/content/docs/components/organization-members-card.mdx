## Requirements

```tsx title="providers.tsx"
<AuthUIProvider
  authClient={authClient}
  organization={{
    customRoles: [
      { role: "developer", label: "Developer" },
      { role: "viewer", label: "Viewer" },
      { role: "billing", label: "Billing Admin" }
    ]
  }}
>
  {children}
</AuthUIProvider>
```
